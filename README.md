# little_livebook_library

[Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) is the interactive notebook for the Elixir programming language. 
To get the most out of the notebooks here, you can open the files with `.livemd` extensions in
livebook and execute and/or fiddle with the code there, though I have tried to make them readable
without Livebook as well, dividing the code up into chunks as digestible as possible, and explaining
each code section.

I have found Livebook a good way to explore small-scale or self-contained ideas, 
or communicate programming concepts.
