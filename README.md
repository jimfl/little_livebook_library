# little_livebook_library

[Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) is the interactive notebook for the Elixir programming language. 
I have found Livebook a good way to explore small-scale or self-contained ideas, 
or communicate programming concepts.

To get the most out of the notebooks here, you can open the files with `.livemd` extensions in
livebook and execute and/or fiddle with the code there, though I have tried to make them readable
without Livebook as well, dividing the code up into chunks as digestible as possible, and explaining
each code section. It turns out to be handy that github renders `.livemd` files as normal markdown.
